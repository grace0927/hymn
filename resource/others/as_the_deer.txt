神哪！我的心切慕祢
As the deer panteth for the water
如鹿渴慕溪水
So my soul longeth after Thee
唯有祢是我心所爱
You alone are my heart's desire
我渴慕来敬拜祢
And I long to worship Thee

祢是我的力量盾牌
You alone are my strength, my shield
我灵单单降服于祢
To you alone may my spirit yield
唯有祢是我心所爱
You alone are my heart's desire
我渴慕来敬拜祢
And I long to worship thee

祢是我好朋友是兄弟，
You're my friend and you are my brother
又是我的大君王，
Even though you are a king
我愛祢超過愛任何人，
I love you more than any other
更超過世上萬物。
So much more than anything

祢是我的力量盾牌
You alone are my strength, my shield
我灵单单降服于祢
To you alone may my spirit yield
唯有祢是我心所爱
You alone are my heart's desire
我渴慕来敬拜祢
And I long to worship thee

我要祢勝過世上金銀，
I want you more than gold or silver,
只有祢能滿足我心。
only you can satisfy.
唯有祢賜我真實喜樂，
You alone are the real joy giver
祢是我眼中瞳仁。
and the apple of my eye.

祢是我的力量盾牌
You alone are my strength, my shield
我灵单单降服于祢
To you alone may my spirit yield
唯有祢是我心所爱
You alone are my heart's desire
我渴慕来敬拜祢
And I long to worship thee
