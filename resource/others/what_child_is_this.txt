是何嬰孩躺臥安睡，在馬利亞胸懷內？
What Child is this, who, laid to rest,
On Mary's lap is sleeping?
牧人正在看守群羊，天使歌唱是為誰？
Whom angels greet with anthems sweet,
While shepherds watch are keeping?
他是基督我王，天使歌唱，牧人歡慶：
This, this is Christ, the King,
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing:
快來向他頌揚，救主，基督，至聖嬰。
Haste, haste to bring Him laud,
The Babe, the Son of Mary!

為何他在卑微地方，牛羊驢馬之身旁？
Why lies He in such mean estate,
Where ox and ass are feeding?
好基督徒衷心思量，主為罪人得釋放。
Good Christian, fear: for sinners here
The silent Word is pleading.
他是基督我王，天使歌唱，牧人歡慶：
This, this is Christ, the King,
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing:
快來向他頌揚，救主，基督，至聖嬰。
Haste, haste to bring Him laud,
The Babe, the Son of Mary!

奉獻黃金乳香沒藥，萬民承認他為王；
So bring Him incense, gold, and myrrh,
Come, peasant, king to own Him.
萬王之王恩賜救贖，心靈當尊他為王。
The King of kings salvation brings;
Let loving hearts enthrone Him.
他是基督我王，天使歌唱，牧人歡慶：
This, this is Christ, the King,
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing:
快來向他頌揚，救主，基督，至聖嬰。
Haste, haste to bring Him laud,
The Babe, the Son of Mary!
